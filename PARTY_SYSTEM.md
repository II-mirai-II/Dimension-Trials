# ðŸ‘¥ Party System Guide

**Cooperative progression system with shared objectives and reduced individual requirements**

## ðŸŒŸ How Parties Work

### **Shared Progress Pool**
- All party members contribute kills to the same objectives
- Requirements automatically scale down by party size
- **Example:** 100 zombie requirement Ã· 4 members = 25 kills each

### **Dynamic Scaling**
- Requirements update instantly as members join/leave
- Works across dimensions - members can hunt in different areas
- Progress persists even when members are offline

### **Smart Synchronization** *(Fixed in v1.3)*
- Fixed kill tracking to properly share between party members
- Corrected HUD display to show shared party progress
- Enhanced client-server synchronization for real-time updates
