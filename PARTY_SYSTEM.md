# ðŸ‘¥ Party System Guide

**NEW in v1.3!** Team up with friends to tackle the challenges together with reduced individual requirements.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Benefits

* **Reduced Requirements:** Mob kill requirements are divided by the number of party members
* **Shared Progress:** All party members contribute to the same objectives
* **Real-time HUD:** See party members, leader status, and current multipliers
* **Persistent Names:** Offline party members show their actual usernames
* **Dynamic Updates:** Requirements automatically adjust when members join/leave

## ðŸŽ® How It Works

* **Example:** If a requirement is 100 zombie kills and you have 4 party members, each member only needs 25 kills
* **Shared Pool:** All kills from party members count toward the same goal
* **Fair Distribution:** Requirements scale down automatically, making progression achievable for teams
